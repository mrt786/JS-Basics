forEach:
    arrayName.forEach(functionName/ function body)
    the function have 1 argunment
    if we return it will not store even with the return statement
Map:
    works same like forEach but it stores the element in the new Array and it'll be of the same size

Every function:
    it has some confition in the body and checks all of the values
     in the and if any one of the case is false then it will save false
    
Some:
    works same like Every if any one is true then it will return true
Filter function:
    some condition in it if it return true then it will be saved into the new array other wise it'll not

Reducer function(accumulator , element):
    first time  the value for accumulator is zero next time after performing an operation and next time the previous returned  value will 
    be in the accumulator and last value it will be returned and saved as a Reduced value

Spread:
    instead of doing index we can use like this
    (...arrayName)
    to print all values individually 
    console.log(...arrayName)
    to convert a string into char array
    arrayName = [..."string", ..."string2"] we can store multiple array
    we can Spread the objects also

Rest:
    opposite to Spread
    function(...args)
    iska sath our argunments ko bhi likh sakta ha 
    function(arg1, ...args ) left side par likhta ha right side par error

Destructuring;
    let names = ["rehan", "ali", "Ahsan" etc]

    let [winner, runnerup,...others] = names[0]
    objects can also be destructured

objects Destructuring:
    let student = {
        name:"rehan",
        age: 17,
        password: 123,
        userName: mrt786,
    }


    let {userName, password} = student
    is case ma propery ko match kar ga our isma store karwa de ga
    let {userName:user, password:secret} = student
    objects ki property ka ilawa bhi hum kisi our variable ma store kar sakta ha 
    we can also give default values if it is not in the objects
    let {userName:user, password:secret,city = "kahuta"} = student
    but if already define ha to phir us case ma original hi le ga
        let {userName:user, password:secret,city:location = "kahuta"} = student
        location variable ban jae ga
