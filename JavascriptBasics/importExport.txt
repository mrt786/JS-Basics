We can import export data from one file to another

export default dataName we can import this by the name can assign
like export default person
import prs form'./filename.js'

the second method is to export multiple form a file 
export{components seperated by a comma}

and import them from their origianl name like that syntax
import{dataName} form './filename.js'
use the exact name as defined in the export file

We can make alias in this case by using the as word

import {person as prs} from''


or to import everything from a file:
import * as keyword from ''.
use them like
keyword.data =
